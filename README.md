# maddpg-replication

This is an attempted replication of "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed
Cooperative-Competitive Environments (Lowe, Wu, Tamar, Harb, Abbeel, Mordatch 2017). That paper introduced an algorithm called MADDPG (multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient) for training multiple agents that can interact intelligently.

This is not an official Google product.
